## üìÇ Projects Overview

### üß£ 1. Invisible Cloak

**Magic meets tech!** Inspired by Harry Potter, this project uses color detection and image segmentation to make a specific colored cloth (like a red cloak) appear invisible in front of a webcam.

* **Core Concepts**: Color space conversion, masking, frame manipulation
* **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy
* **Real-World Applications**: Visual effects, background replacement

### üé® 2. Air Canvas

Draw anything in the air using just your hand and webcam! The system detects fingertip coordinates and maps them to a virtual canvas.

* **Core Concepts**: Hand tracking, gesture detection, image drawing
* **Libraries**: OpenCV, MediaPipe
* **Features**: Multiple colors, eraser mode, smooth drawing

### ü§ü 3. Sign Language Detector (with Speech Output)

This deep learning project recognizes ASL (American Sign Language) alphabets in real-time using a webcam feed and a pre-trained CNN model. The system also **speaks out** the detected letter using text-to-speech.

* **Core Concepts**: Convolutional Neural Networks, image classification, real-time prediction
* **Libraries**: Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV, pyttsx3/gTTS, Streamlit (for GUI)
* **Bonus**: Easy-to-use interface and real-time audio feedback

### üñ±Ô∏è 4. Virtual Mouse using Hand Gestures

Control your mouse pointer using your hand movements‚Äîno physical mouse needed. Perform left click, right click, and scrolling gestures using hand signs.

* **Core Concepts**: Hand tracking, gesture control, system automation
* **Libraries**: MediaPipe, OpenCV, PyAutoGUI
* **Real-World Applications**: Touchless interaction, accessibility solutions
